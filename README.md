 HTML

 1/5: i've used basic structure throughout every html page i made.

 2/5: I've used lists, see about.html. Headings in every html file, paragraphs in a couple, see about html.

 3/5: links in a couple of the html files, for example projects. Forms in form.html. Media see gallery.html.

 4/5  about.html and related css modifications.

 5/5: i tried to use specific tags where needed throughout all my html files, while avoid unnecessary ones. For example: nav for a navigation bar, table for, well tables. Etc..

 CSS

 1/5: Font changes, background colour changes etc...

 2/5: If you look at some of the html files you see i've used plenty of id's + classes and modified them in css specifically.

 3/5: look at the end of my style.css file.

 4/5: look at form.html. I used grid layout to make it easy to modify.

 5/5: I believe overall i used the tools i had in hand while still keeping the website very simple, easy to use for the user.

 JavaScript Basics

1/5: Submit button in survey page informs the user that the feedback has been submitted. Copy buttons in contact page also do similiar.

2/5: All the buttons i implemented are event listeners. Some of them do DOM manipulations. For example: images in gallery.html as well as buttons in contact.html.

3/5: overall i used a lot of functions for this website, see functions.js. For arrays, check projects.html + language.js. For objects check about.html and aboutTable.js

4/5: see languages.js as well as gallerybuttons.js. In both of those i use forEach loops to read data. Gallery does "dynamic DOM updates" because the user click a button and the image switches to next or previous.

Asynchronous Operations

1/5:

I have a timer for the white/dark mode button, that is present in all of the html files.
I also made a timer to show current time. See the function in functions.js, called currentTime();

2/5: I used a fetch call to get the text for a paragraph in about.html. See the "infoText" paragraph there as well as fetchInfoText() function at functions.js
