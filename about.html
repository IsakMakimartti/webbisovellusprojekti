        Hi! Thanks for checking out my Web page. I am a student at Oulu University of Applied Sciences. Currently studying Information Technology and it's my second year now. 
        My interests are programming and software development  in general, which is why i chose to specialize in software development. Working on different projects has been especially fun, getting to really put things you've learned into practice. 
        Working in an actual work environment is something i'm really looking forward to and also a tiny bit scared of. I'm sure it will be a great learning experience and i'm excited to see what the future holds.
